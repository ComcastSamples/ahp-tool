# Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) Tool

To try it out, go to [https://comcastsamples.github.io/ahp-tool/](https://comcastsamples.github.io/ahp-tool/).

## A note before you use this

The calculator works, but currently there is nothing in place to save your data. So if you accidentally navigate back in your browser, it's possible all your data could be lost. Until that feature is added, it is recommended that while you are entering data into the tool, you also record that same data in a spreadsheet.

Pull requests are welcome :-)

## What is the Analytic Hierarchy Process?

It is a structured technique to aid you and your teams in decision making. [Wikipedia's article on AHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_hierarchy_process) does an excellent job explaining it.

With the help of the [ahp node package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ahp) and [charist.js](https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/), we were able to make this AHP visualization tool a reality.
