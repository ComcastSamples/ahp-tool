## What is the Analytic Hierarchy Process?

It is a structured technique to aid you and your teams in decision making. [Wikipedia's article on AHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_hierarchy_process) does an excellent job explaining it.

With the help of the [ahp node package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ahp) and [charist.js](https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/), we were able to make this AHP visualization tool a reality.
